### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

My name is Salla. I am currently studying in Helsinki Business School to become a web developer. I'm especially interested in designing and game developing. So far I have been learning HTML, JavaScript, React, PHP, CSS and SQL. I have also learned basics of Java at the Helsinki University MOOC. 

In my free time I like to garden, listen to heavy metal and do handicrafts.
